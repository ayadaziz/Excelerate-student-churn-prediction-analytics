# Project Journey

## Week 1: Data Preparation

### Data Overview
- **Dataset Size**: 8,558 records, 16 variables
- **Data Types**: Categorical, temporal, demographic attributes
- **Key Fields**: Signup timestamps, opportunity classifications, geographic data

### Preprocessing Achievements
- Standardized date/time formats using `pd.to_datetime()`
- Resolved missing values in critical fields
- Normalized institution names for consistency
- Removed test entries and malformed records
- **No duplicates found** - indicating strong data integrity

### Feature Engineering
Created **8+ new features** to enrich analysis:

```{r features-table, echo=FALSE}
features <- data.frame(
  Feature = c("Age", "Engagement Time", "Season", "Time Committed", 
              "Quick Applicant", "Fast Starter", "Opportunity Duration", "Engagement Score"),
  Description = c("Calculated from Date of Birth", "Time spent in system", 
                  "Application season categorization", "Total commitment hours",
                  "Applied quickly after signup", "Started program quickly", 
                  "Length of opportunity", "Composite engagement metric"),
  Purpose = c("Demographic analysis", "Behavioral patterns", "Seasonal trends", 
              "Commitment prediction", "Urgency indicator", "Efficiency measure",
              "Program analysis", "Churn prediction")
)

kable(features, caption = "Engineered Features") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "300px")
```

## Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Visualisation Strategy
- **Tools Used**: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Python pandas
- **Team Approach**: Divided visualisation tasks among team members
- **Graph Types**: Box plots, count plots, correlation heatmaps, pairplots

### Key Patterns Discovered

#### Seasonal Application Trends
- **Winter Peak**: ~5,000 applications (massive spike)
- **Moderate Seasons**: Fall, Spring, Summer (800-1,500 each)
- **Hypothesis**: Reduced outdoor activities drive winter applications

#### Demographic Insights  
- **Age Distribution**: The 18-25 age group dominates participation
- **Geographic Concentration**: US, India, Nigeria lead in learner count
- **Commitment Patterns**: Younger learners show longer completion times

## Week 3: Churn Analysis & Predictive Modelling

### Churn Definition
Implemented **hybrid churn identification**:

1. **Explicit Churn**: Status = ['rejected', 'dropped out', 'withdraw']
2. **Implicit Churn**: 'team allocated' + opportunity ended >1 year ago

### Model Development Pipeline

```{r model-pipeline, echo=FALSE}
pipeline <- data.frame(
  Step = 1:6,
  Process = c("Feature Selection", "One-Hot Encoding", "Multicollinearity Removal", 
              "SMOTE Balancing", "Train-Test Split", "Model Training"),
  Description = c("Domain knowledge + EDA insights", "Categorical variables", 
                  "VIF analysis", "Address 70:30 imbalance", "80:20 stratified", 
                  "Multiple algorithms tested")
)

kable(pipeline, caption = "Machine Learning Pipeline") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

### Model Performance Comparison

```{r model-performance, echo=FALSE}
models <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Random Forest", "LightGBM", "XGBoost", "Logistic Regression"),
  Accuracy = c("85.2%", "84.8%", "84.1%", "82.3%"),
  ROC_AUC = c("0.87", "0.89", "0.86", "0.83"),
  F1_Score = c("0.85", "0.84", "0.84", "0.82"),
  Best_For = c("Overall Performance", "Ranking Ability", "Feature Importance", "Baseline")
)

kable(models, caption = "Model Performance Metrics") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed")) %>%
  row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#3498db") %>%
  row_spec(2, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#2ecc71")
```

## Week 4: Insights & Recommendations

### Critical Churn Drivers Identified

1. **Days from Signup to Application**: Longer delays â†’ Higher churn
2. **Time Committed**: More engagement hours â†’ Lower churn risk  
3. **Application Frequency**: Multiple applications affect retention
4. **Profile Completeness**: Incomplete profiles â†’ Higher dropout risk

    return df
```


## Model Architecture

### Feature Engineering Process

**Feature engineering was performed using Excel formulas** to transform raw data into meaningful predictive variables. Key examples include:

#### Age Calculation
```excel
=DATEDIF(G4, A4, "Y")
```
*Where Column A = signup date, Column G = birth date*

#### Opportunity Duration
```excel
=DAYS(E4,P4)
```
*Where Column E = opportunity end date, Column P = opportunity start date*

#### Engagement Score (Composite Metric)
```excel
=IF(S2 <> "N/A", (S2 * 0.3 + R2 * 0.4 + Q2 * 0.3), (Q2*0.4 + R2*0.4))
```
*Weighted combination of days to start, duration, and age*

#### Days from Signup to Application
```excel
=DAYS(O10, A10)
```
*Where Column O = application date, Column A = signup date*

#### Fast Applicant Flag
```excel
=IF(AND(Z2 >= 0, Z2 <= 3), TRUE, FALSE)
```
*Where Z2 = days from signup to application*

#### Application Season Classification
```excel
=IF(AND(MONTH(O2) >= 6, MONTH(O2) <= 8), "Summer", 
   IF(AND(MONTH(O2) >= 9, MONTH(O2) <= 11), "Fall", 
      IF(OR(MONTH(O2) = 12, MONTH(O2) <= 2), "Winter", "Spring")))
```

This Excel-based approach allowed for **rapid prototyping** and **easy validation** of feature logic before implementing it in the machine learning pipeline.
